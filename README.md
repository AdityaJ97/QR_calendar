# QR_calendar

This application scans the qrcode and fill the calendar with the information which is encoded in it on that particular that.
So basically whenever you want to put any notice you just encode the information, make a qrcode and print it. The other person will just
scan it and will be able to see the information as well as save it which it makes it userfriendly as there is no need to feed the
information to the calendar.
